# <a name="chapter2"></a> 2 - UNIX Standardization and Implementations

Mostly tables, and enumerations from POSIX's standards. There are also some type limits from POSIX and standard C and other different constants, there isn't code really so you can take a quick look to it.
Some functions listed here are: sysconf, pathconf, fpathconf.
You have also pathname limits, maximum number of open files, primitive system data types listed in header "<sys/types.h>" and finally differences between standards.
