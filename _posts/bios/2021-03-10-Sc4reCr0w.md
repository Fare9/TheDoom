For those who are reading this I hope you won't get bored reading these few lines about me. My real name is Jorge Sánchez but people near me always used to call me scarecrow but that wasn't cool enough so I changed it adding some numbers, you know, like a real 'hackerman' so I'm known as Sc4reCrow in most forums, groups and videogames. At the moment I'm working at Indoamerica's University leading some web projects. I'm also a cybersecurity consultant focusing mainly in non-technical people which are the most common target to attack. I'm a Social Engineering enthusiast so my main research is about it, developing some small tools to gather info by a well planned attack and teaching people how to avoid or detect it. I love this kind of research because it is something that happens every day, maybe some of you had received a phishing email too. I've also worked with some companies creating Information Security Policies and performing some Pentesting projects, mainly at small banks which were attacked and needed a little help. I got my Master's degree in at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and my System's Engineering degree at Universidad Técnica de Ambato. My interests on this field include SET (Social Engineering Techniques), Pentesting and Forensics. Some of these skills helped me to be in a Cybersecurity contests and gave me the opportunity to be on the 3rd place by completing a lot of tasks and CTFs.

## Hobbies

It's important to have some time for yourself and do anything that makes you calm and happy. For me, well I love videogames, mostly Call of Duty and League of Legends (I use to play in LAN if someone wants to play a little), I also like the Assassins Creed saga (in fact I have a tattoo about it). 

I use to practice Capoeira with my friends at weekends.

Finally but not least important, I like to listen to music and also play drums. Some of my favorite songs will be included in the section below.

## Music

In any top I have of music these songs are a must listen to:

[Waking the Demon - Bullet for my Valentine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2I0ulTZWXA)

[A little piece of heaven - Avenged Sevenfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjBCT2Lc94)
